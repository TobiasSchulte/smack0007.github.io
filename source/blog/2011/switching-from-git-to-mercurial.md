I've decided to make the switch from using git to Mercurial. Git's syntax to me is much more complicated than it needs to be and Mercurial seems to be more my style. I find it's much easier to find out how to do things with Mercurial and to be honest, I use about 10% of the functionality in either git or Mercurial.

This also means I'll be transitioning Snowball to Codeplex I think. I'll be moving it away from GitHub for sure just not 100% sure where.
