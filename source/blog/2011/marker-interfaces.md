In Snowball I was debating adding an empty interface to identify certain classes in my framework as components. I wasn't sure if this was code smell or not so I did some searching on [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=marker+interface) and found out this concept is actually called "Marker Interfaces". Learn something new every day.
