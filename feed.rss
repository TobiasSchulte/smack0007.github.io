		<title><![CDATA[Using batch files as the task runner in Visual Studio Code]]></title>
		<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> allows you specify tasks which can be in a task runner. Most examples
I've seen show how to integrate with Javascript task runners such as Gulp. There is no reason why you can't simpley use
batch files though.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>This is a problem that has bitten me more than a few times so I thought it was about time to write a blog post about it. It's one of those problems
that makes you scratch your head for a bit and then the light bulb goes on and you remember you've solved this one before. It occurs whenever you
use a LINQ extension method which takes an instance of IEqualityComaparer<T>.</p>

		<title><![CDATA[My Experience with OpenGL vs Direct3D]]></title>
		<description><![CDATA[<p>I've struggled a lot with myself over whether I should use OpenGL or Direct3D. There is no blanket answer to this question that anyone can tell you.
Both APIs have a very different feel and which one you prefer can only be decided on your own.</p>

		<title><![CDATA[Adding assembly references in Roslyn]]></title>
		<description><![CDATA[<p>In the Roslyn preview that was released at Build 2014 the way references to global assmeblies are added was changed. Before the preview I could use code like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">var compilation = Compilation.Create(assemblyName, new CompilationOptions(OutputKind.DynamicallyLinkedLibrary))
	.AddReferences(MetadataReference.CreateAssemblyReference(&quot;mscorlib&quot;))
	.AddReferences(MetadataReference.CreateAssemblyReference(&quot;System&quot;))
	.AddReferences(MetadataReference.CreateAssemblyReference(&quot;System.Core&quot;))
	.AddReferences(new MetadataFileReference(this.GetType().Assembly.Location))
	.AddSyntaxTrees(syntaxTree);
</code></pre>
<p>The static factory method &quot;MetadataReference.CreateAssemblyReference&quot; added a reference to global assemblies such as &quot;mscorlib.dll&quot; or &quot;System.dll&quot;. In the Roslyn preview,
the same be achieved like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">var assemblyPath = Path.GetDirectoryName(typeof(object).Assembly.Location);

var compilation = CSharpCompilation.Create(assemblyName)
	.WithOptions(new CSharpCompilationOptions(OutputKind.DynamicallyLinkedLibrary))
	.AddReferences(new MetadataFileReference(Path.Combine(assemblyPath, &quot;mscorlib.dll&quot;)))
	.AddReferences(new MetadataFileReference(Path.Combine(assemblyPath, &quot;System.dll&quot;)))
	.AddReferences(new MetadataFileReference(Path.Combine(assemblyPath, &quot;System.Core.dll&quot;)))
	.AddReferences(new MetadataFileReference(Assembly.GetEntryAssembly().Location))
	.AddSyntaxTrees(syntaxTree);
</code></pre>

		<title><![CDATA[All the cool kids are static]]></title>
		<description><![CDATA[<p>Seems like all the cool kids these days have converted their websites to completely static ones. I'm looking at you <a href="http://haacked.com">Mr. Haacked</a>. I thought this was a pretty cool idea and a chance
to really refresh my website so I decided to take a stab at it. It's currently a work in progress.</p>
<p>I ended up writing my own tool I call <a href="http://github.com/smack0007/Gatsby">Gatsby</a> to do it. I also set up the whole deploy process myself involving pushing to <a href="http://github.com/smack0007/zacharysnow.net">Github</a>
which then informs my website to pull from the Github repository. Hopefully that will be a blog post in the not too distance future.</p>
<p>Sorry for any inconvenience.</p>

		<title><![CDATA[Using Component Glue to build your object graphs automatically]]></title>
		<description><![CDATA[<p>Component Glue is an IoC container and you use it of course to wire up your object graphs for you. Component Glue can also build your object graphs for you automatically if there are no interfaces involved. Take this example:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/smack0007/6091538.js"></script>
<p>In After.cs, you can see that Component Glue is able to build the entire object graph for us. This will include all future dependencies as well so long as interfaces don't come into play. Should an interface be needed, you can just bind that single component.</p>
<p>This is a very powerful thing. If one component needs to take on a dependency, just ask for it in the constructor and Component Glue will handle it for you.</p>

		<title><![CDATA[Component Glue v1.0]]></title>
		<description><![CDATA[<p>I finally brought Component Glue up to a state where I felt like the product was finished. You can get it via NuGet:</p>
<div class="nuget-badge">
`PM&gt; Install-Package ComponentGlue`
</div>
<p>or you can get the source from <a href="https://github.com/smack0007/ComponentGlue">GitHub</a>. The documentation is definitely sparse I know but I recommend taking a look at the unit tests to get a feel for what you can do with Component Glue.</p>

		<title><![CDATA[Introducing GLDotNet]]></title>
		<description><![CDATA[<p>Today I released a project I've been playing around with for a year or so on Codeplex. It's called <a href="https://gldotnet.codeplex.com/">GLDotNet</a>. From the project description:</p>
<p><em>C# wrapper for OpenGL. Partially generated from the OpenGL spec and partially written by hand, the aim is to have a flexible and native feeling C# binding.</em></p>
<p>I have generated functions from the OpenGL spec excluding 1 or 2 but unfortunately of the generated code is untested. There is a demo project included in the source code. The Github repository is located here: <a href="https://github.com/smack0007/GLDotNet">https://github.com/smack0007/GLDotNet</a></p>

		<title><![CDATA[Snowball is now modular]]></title>
		<description><![CDATA[<p>The version of Snowball currently on GitHub under the &quot;develop&quot; branch has been split into multiple projects. There is now an assembly for each major piece of Snowball, such as Graphics, Input, Sound. Although this means having to reference more assemblies, the amount of code your project depends on is now smaller. This also makes code maintenance a bit easier as it's more clear now what parts of the library depend on other parts of the library.</p>
<p>The parts of the library which really make up a Game Framework has also been split out into their own library. This allows for using Snowball as a just a simple set of libraries or a full blown game framework, depending on what your situation calls for.</p>

		<title><![CDATA[Using Themes in Visual Studio Express for Windows Desktop]]></title>
		<description><![CDATA[<p>I just want to post some information that took me while to find. Check out the original article <a href="http://alinconstantin.blogspot.de/2012/09/using-color-themes-with-visual-studio.html">here</a> with pictures and more information.</p>
<blockquote>
1) First, download the zip file http://www.alinconstantin.net/download/VS2012Themes.zip – it contains the 7 pkgdef files defining the colors of the default themes from Matt’s extension.
<ol start="2">
<li><p>Now, create a folder under &quot;%ProgramFiles%\Microsoft Visual Studio 11.0\Common7\IDE\WDExpressExtensions”, and lets name it “Themes”. Unpack the zip file in that folder.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Open a ‘Developer Command Prompt for VS2012” window. In the command line, type “wdexpress.exe /updateconfiguration”. This will make Visual Studio to read the pkgdef files on next restart, and import the color themes into registry.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Launch Visual Studio Express, and now you should be able to see the new themes and switch them in Tools/Options dialog, Environment/General tab</p>
</li>
</ol>

		<title><![CDATA[ID3DXEffect::OnLostDevice()]]></title>
		<description><![CDATA[<p>I fixed a bug yesterday in Snowball related to a lost graphics device. I noticed that when I would use CTRL + ALT + DELETE, my apps were crashing. Turned out it was due to not recovering properly from a lost device.</p>
<p>The root of the problem was that I needed to call the ID3DXEffect::OnLostDevice() method when the device was being lost. This allows the effect to recover from the lost device. I've made the Effect class in Snowball now do this automatically.</p>

		<title><![CDATA[Snowball: Now based on shaders]]></title>
		<description><![CDATA[<p>I've now merged the &quot;Shaders&quot; branch back into the &quot;master&quot; branch. All rendering is now based on shaders and no longer on the fixed function pipeline.</p>
<p>The function of the Renderer class was essentially been reduced to pushing data to the GPU and therefore I decided to rename the class to GraphicsBatch. The Begin() overload which would allow you to specify RendererSettings has been removed and been replaced with an overload which allows you to specify an Effect file to use. Also, the DrawLine() method has been removed, although vertical and horizontal lines can still be drawn using the DrawFilledRectangle() method. Better line drawing should be possible through shaders and I hope to eventually make a sample which provides an example.</p>
<p>I've added a sample (pictured above) which demonstrates using a custom shader. By default, GraphicsBatch uses a BasicEffect class which is basically the old way of rendering implemented in a shader.</p>
<p>In order for shaders to work properly when using GraphicsBatch, the GraphicsBatch class must pass a few parameters to the shader. At the moment, this only includes a transform matrix but may include more parameters in the future. The GraphicsBatchEffectWrapper can be used to wrap custom effects which you write in order to work with GraphicsBatch correctly. GraphicsBatchEffectWrapper will pass the parameters to your shader by following a standard naming convention. For example, the transform matrix is passed to your shader through a parameter named &quot;TransformMatrix&quot;.  You can also write you own class which implements IGraphicsBatchEffect. See the sample for an example of using the wrapper class.</p>

		<title><![CDATA[Snowball: \Shaders\ in progress]]></title>
		<description><![CDATA[<p>It's been a long couple of months. I'm in the middle of switching jobs, been on vacation a bit, and have been playing around with OpenGL a bit to get a feel for how that API works compared to Direct3D. As of yesterday I started working on implementing shaders in Snowball.</p>
<p>In order to implement shaders or Effect(s), there may have to be a few changes to the API / interface of the Renderer class. Nothing significant I don't think but mainly changes to the Begin() method overloads. Today I pushed the branch which contains my initial implementation.</p>

		<title><![CDATA[Snowball now using SharpDX]]></title>
		<description><![CDATA[<p>For a little while, I was thinking about giving up on Snowball. When you're one guy working on a project that gets to a certain size, it can start to feel a little daunting. You find a bug, and you feel like you need to fix it asap. I don't know if anyone reading this has actually tried Snowball, but if you have, please comment to let me know. It would encourage me.</p>
<p>I decided to switch Snowball over to <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sharpdx/">SharpDX</a>. It's not that I was unhappy with SlimDX, it just seems like there is a lot more innovation happening on the SharpDX side. I also like the fact that I can include the DLLs in the repository so end users don't have to download another dependency in order to compile it. The Win8 stuff is also quite interesting, although the SlimDX guys say they are working on that.</p>
<p>I plan to set a road map soon for what I want to include the first release of Snowball. Music and Pixel Shaders are high the list. I've experimented with implementing a UI library but I think I want to push that back for a later release.</p>

		<title><![CDATA[Getting Started with Snowball]]></title>
		<description><![CDATA[<p>My game framework Snowball is far enough along that small games can be developed with it by now. The basic overall design is now laid out and not too much is likely to change as I'm now developing my own small games with it.</p>
<p>In order to create some kind of documentation on how to use Snowball, I created a Samples folder in the source. In the Samples folder is a WalkingWizard sample. I'm posting this source code here but it can also be viewed on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/smack0007/Snowball/blob/master/Samples/WalkingWizard/WalkingWizardSample.cs">here</a>.</p>

		<title><![CDATA[What is Snowball and what do I want to do with it?]]></title>
		<description><![CDATA[<p>I originally got the idea for Snowball after working with the Xna Framework. The Xna Framework is a good piece of software for what it is but there are some things about which I just do not agree with:</p>
<ul>
<li>The content pipeline only works with content in the serialized .xnb format.</li>
<li>There are certain content types which can only be loaded via the content pipeline.</li>
<li>Certain features don't exist on the PC because they don't exist on the XBox or Windows Phone 7.</li>
</ul>
<p>Xna was designed as an abstraction layer for all the 3 platforms mentioned in the last point, so that one is somewhat understandable. I don't want to write games for my XBox right now though, so why should things like drawing lines not be available to me?</p>
<p>With these points in mind I started working on <a href="http://snowball.codeplex.com/">Snowball</a>. It's designed to be an Xna like framework for making 2D games. It uses SlimDX on the backend, but that is completely abstracted away from consumers of the framework. What I want to do is design the API so that the backend can be swapped out <strong>somewhat</strong> painlessly.</p>
<p>I still have a ways to go before I will consider it a version 1.0 release. As of this writing, I'm transitioning to more of a ContentLoader class style for loading your game's content. Any resource type from within the framework can be loaded by hand if you want, the ContentLoader class will just make it easier. After that I have a few other features like GamePad and Music which I would like to implement before saying I have a Beta type release.</p>
<p>The future after that is up in the air. I would love to try and have different implementations of the API for Xna and/or OpenTK.</p>
<p>I recommend for anyone who is interested as to why an API designer choose to implement the API in the way they did to try it for themselves. I have learned many things from this project including why certain design decisions were made by the Xna Framework team.</p>
