<p>I finally brought Component Glue up to a state where I felt like the product was finished. You can get it via NuGet:</p>
<div class="nuget-badge">
`PM&gt; Install-Package ComponentGlue`
</div>
<p>or you can get the source from <a href="https://github.com/smack0007/ComponentGlue">GitHub</a>. The documentation is definitely sparse I know but I recommend taking a look at the unit tests to get a feel for what you can do with Component Glue.</p>
