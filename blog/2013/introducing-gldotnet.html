        <h2>Introducing GLDotNet</h2>
<p>Today I released a project I've been playing around with for a year or so on Codeplex. It's called <a href="https://gldotnet.codeplex.com/">GLDotNet</a>. From the project description:</p>
<p><em>C# wrapper for OpenGL. Partially generated from the OpenGL spec and partially written by hand, the aim is to have a flexible and native feeling C# binding.</em></p>
<p>I have generated functions from the OpenGL spec excluding 1 or 2 but unfortunately of the generated code is untested. There is a demo project included in the source code. The Github repository is located here: <a href="https://github.com/smack0007/GLDotNet">https://github.com/smack0007/GLDotNet</a></p>
