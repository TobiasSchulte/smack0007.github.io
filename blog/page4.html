<p>I've now merged the &quot;Shaders&quot; branch back into the &quot;master&quot; branch. All rendering is now based on shaders and no longer on the fixed function pipeline.</p>
<p>The function of the Renderer class was essentially been reduced to pushing data to the GPU and therefore I decided to rename the class to GraphicsBatch. The Begin() overload which would allow you to specify RendererSettings has been removed and been replaced with an overload which allows you to specify an Effect file to use. Also, the DrawLine() method has been removed, although vertical and horizontal lines can still be drawn using the DrawFilledRectangle() method. Better line drawing should be possible through shaders and I hope to eventually make a sample which provides an example.</p>
<p>I've added a sample (pictured above) which demonstrates using a custom shader. By default, GraphicsBatch uses a BasicEffect class which is basically the old way of rendering implemented in a shader.</p>
<p>In order for shaders to work properly when using GraphicsBatch, the GraphicsBatch class must pass a few parameters to the shader. At the moment, this only includes a transform matrix but may include more parameters in the future. The GraphicsBatchEffectWrapper can be used to wrap custom effects which you write in order to work with GraphicsBatch correctly. GraphicsBatchEffectWrapper will pass the parameters to your shader by following a standard naming convention. For example, the transform matrix is passed to your shader through a parameter named &quot;TransformMatrix&quot;.  You can also write you own class which implements IGraphicsBatchEffect. See the sample for an example of using the wrapper class.</p>

<p>It's been a long couple of months. I'm in the middle of switching jobs, been on vacation a bit, and have been playing around with OpenGL a bit to get a feel for how that API works compared to Direct3D. As of yesterday I started working on implementing shaders in Snowball.</p>
<p>In order to implement shaders or Effect(s), there may have to be a few changes to the API / interface of the Renderer class. Nothing significant I don't think but mainly changes to the Begin() method overloads. Today I pushed the branch which contains my initial implementation.</p>

<p>For a little while, I was thinking about giving up on Snowball. When you're one guy working on a project that gets to a certain size, it can start to feel a little daunting. You find a bug, and you feel like you need to fix it asap. I don't know if anyone reading this has actually tried Snowball, but if you have, please comment to let me know. It would encourage me.</p>
<p>I decided to switch Snowball over to <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sharpdx/">SharpDX</a>. It's not that I was unhappy with SlimDX, it just seems like there is a lot more innovation happening on the SharpDX side. I also like the fact that I can include the DLLs in the repository so end users don't have to download another dependency in order to compile it. The Win8 stuff is also quite interesting, although the SlimDX guys say they are working on that.</p>
<p>I plan to set a road map soon for what I want to include the first release of Snowball. Music and Pixel Shaders are high the list. I've experimented with implementing a UI library but I think I want to push that back for a later release.</p>

<p>My game framework Snowball is far enough along that small games can be developed with it by now. The basic overall design is now laid out and not too much is likely to change as I'm now developing my own small games with it.</p>
<p>In order to create some kind of documentation on how to use Snowball, I created a Samples folder in the source. In the Samples folder is a WalkingWizard sample. I'm posting this source code here but it can also be viewed on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/smack0007/Snowball/blob/master/Samples/WalkingWizard/WalkingWizardSample.cs">here</a>.</p>

<p>I've always wanted a program that would allow me have a command line that I could slide in and out of view as needed like the console from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_(video_game)">Quake</a>. I never could find one and so I finally got decided to write a tool myself. A picture is below and the source code is on <a href="https://github.com/smack0007/WinQuakeCon">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>I'm not putting a download here as I don't consider this finished just yet.</p>
