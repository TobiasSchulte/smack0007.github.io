        <h2>Snowball: A Slightly Different Direction</h2>
        <p>At first, I had imagined <a href="http://snowball.codeplex.com/">Snowball</a>, now located on Codeplex, to be a framework which would define how your game objects look. I.E. I had a class called GameEntity which I imagined would handle a lot of boiler plate code for you such as setting up Initialize(), Update(), Draw(), etc.</p>
<p>I've decided to move away from that and let Snowball purely focus on the subsystems of a game, such as Graphics, Sound, Input, etc. Extending from the Game class completely sets up these aspects of your game for you. I think I will include helper components, such as a collision detection system, but I will not force you to use them.</p>
