        <h2>Keeping SplitContainer SplitterDistance consistent</h2>
        <p>If you're having trouble keeping the SplitterDistance property of a SplitContainer consistent across app sessions, you can set the FixedPanel property of the splitter to FixedPanel.Panel1.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c#">splitter.FixedPanel = FixedPanel.Panel1;
</code></pre>
<p>I guess this could also work with FixedPanel.Panel2 as well but I haven't given it a try. Credit <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/129362/restoring-splitterdistance-inside-tabcontrol-is-inconsistent">this stackoverflow post</a>.</p>
