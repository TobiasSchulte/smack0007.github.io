        <h2>WinQuakeCon</h2>
<p>I've always wanted a program that would allow me have a command line that I could slide in and out of view as needed like the console from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_(video_game)">Quake</a>. I never could find one and so I finally got decided to write a tool myself. A picture is below and the source code is on <a href="https://github.com/smack0007/WinQuakeCon">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>I'm not putting a download here as I don't consider this finished just yet.</p>
