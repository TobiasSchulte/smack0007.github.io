        <h2>Marker Interfaces</h2>
<p>In Snowball I was debating adding an empty interface to identify certain classes in my framework as components. I wasn't sure if this was code smell or not so I did some searching on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=marker+interface">Stackoverflow</a> and found out this concept is actually called &quot;Marker Interfaces&quot;. Learn something new every day.</p>
