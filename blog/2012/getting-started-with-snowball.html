        <p><a href="http://zacharysnow.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/WalkingWizardSample.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-487" title="WalkingWizardSample" src="http://zacharysnow.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/WalkingWizardSample-300x234.png" alt="" width="300" height="234" /></a></p>
<p>My game framework Snowball is far enough along that small games can be developed with it by now. The basic overall design is now laid out and not too much is likely to change as I'm now developing my own small games with it.</p>
<p>In order to create some kind of documentation on how to use Snowball, I created a Samples folder in the source. In the Samples folder is a WalkingWizard sample. I'm posting this source code here but it can also be viewed on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/smack0007/Snowball/blob/master/Samples/WalkingWizard/WalkingWizardSample.cs">here</a>.</p>
