        <h2>All the cool kids are static</h2>
<p>Seems like all the cool kids these days have converted their websites to completely static ones. I'm looking at you <a href="http://haacked.com">Mr. Haacked</a>. I thought this was a pretty cool idea and a chance
to really refresh my website so I decided to take a stab at it. It's currently a work in progress.</p>
<p>I ended up writing my own tool I call <a href="http://github.com/smack0007/Gatsby">Gatsby</a> to do it. I also set up the whole deploy process myself involving pushing to <a href="http://github.com/smack0007/zacharysnow.net">Github</a>
which then informs my website to pull from the Github repository. Hopefully that will be a blog post in the not too distance future.</p>
<p>Sorry for any inconvenience.</p>
