<p>I recently became interested in doing MVC inside of a Windows Forms app. I found a few MVC frameworks which work with WinForms (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2406/looking-for-a-mvc-sample-for-winforms">see here</a>) but they didn't really interest me. Too heavy I felt for what I was looking to do. I ended up with a solution looking something like this:</p>
<p>There is really only one controller and that is the &quot;Application&quot; class. It contains all the methods your app can call to manipulate your models, which are in the &quot;Data&quot; folder / namespace. The &quot;WinFormsApplication&quot; class inherits from the &quot;Application&quot; class and just sets the view to an instance of &quot;WinFormsView&quot;. The &quot;Application&quot; class communicates with the view through the &quot;IView&quot; interface. The &quot;WinFormsView&quot; class is a Windows Forms implementation of that view. The &quot;Application&quot; class and your models are not coupled in any way to your Windows Forms implementation of the view.</p>
<p>If you want you view to be as dumb as possible, your view can communicate with the &quot;Application&quot; class only through events. In my case though, I choose to go with a smart view and have the view call back to methods in the &quot;Application&quot; class. The &quot;Application&quot; class tells the view when models are loaded and unloaded. The view subscribes to events on the models and reacts to the events.</p>
<p>All of my forms and controls communicate with each other through the &quot;WinFormsView&quot; class. One control might change the value of a property in the &quot;WinFormsView&quot; class and another control might subscribe to a change event and update as necessary. This keeps the controls and forms slightly less coupled.</p>
<p>It's not a perfect implementation of MVC but it keeps my model logic decoupled enough from my view logic that I can later implement a WPF version of the view I think.</p>
