        <h2>500 Downloads of the Same Game</h2>
<p>My little Xna game that I wrote nearly 2 years ago reached the 500 downloads mark (binaries and source) the other day. With that said, I'd like to say that I'm working on version 2.0.</p>
<p>In version 2.0 I'm going to make the code more event driven. The old code uses the Xna Game class and in the new version I'll be making it WinForms based. Almost a complete rewrite.</p>
<p>My work so far is available through SVN on the project's <a href="http://samegamexna.codeplex.com/">Codeplex page</a>.</p>
